# Digit-Recognizer-using-PyTorch
In the digit recognition project, PyTorch and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) were utilized to accomplish the task. The objective was to create a model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

To begin, the necessary libraries were imported, including PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. The MNIST dataset was then loaded using PyTorch's built-in datasets module. This dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits, each accompanied by a label representing the corresponding digit (0-9).

Preprocessing of the dataset was carried out, involving the normalization of pixel values and conversion of each image into a sequence of vectors. This conversion treated each row of pixels in the image as a timestep in the sequence, aligning with the RNN's sequential processing nature.

The architecture of the RNN model was defined using PyTorch's nn.Module class. For this digit recognition task, a simple RNN layer was chosen as the recurrent layer. The RNN model comprised an input layer, a single RNN layer, and an output layer. The RNN layer processed the input sequence, passing its hidden state to the output layer. The output layer, typically a fully connected layer, produced a probability distribution over the possible digit classes using softmax activation.

Following the model definition, the training process commenced using the training data. Batches of input sequences were fed into the model, predictions were computed, and a loss function, such as cross-entropy loss, was employed to measure the discrepancy between the predictions and true labels.

To optimize the model's parameters, backpropagation and optimization algorithms available in PyTorch, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), were utilized. These techniques allowed the model to adjust its parameters iteratively, minimizing the loss and enhancing the accuracy of digit recognition.

After training, the model's performance was evaluated using the test data. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to assess the model's proficiency in classifying unseen images.

To gain further insights into the model's performance, visualization of its predictions on a set of test images was carried out. This involved plotting the input images alongside the predicted and true labels, providing a means to identify any misclassifications or patterns within the data.

In summary, PyTorch and a simple RNN model were employed in the digit recognition project, resulting in an accurate classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
